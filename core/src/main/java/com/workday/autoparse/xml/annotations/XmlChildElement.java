/**
 * Indicates to the Autoparse framework that the target field should be inflated from a child
 * element. The corresponding class (or a subclass) must be annotated with {@link XmlElement}. If
 * the target of this annotation is a {@link java.util.Collection}, then the inflated child object
 * will be added to it.
 * <p/>
 * This annotation can also be used on a setter method. The method must be non-private and must take
 * exactly one parameter. The rules for fields apply to the parameter.
 * <p/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> If the target of this annotation is a Collection field, then that list must be
 * instantiated by the class. The framework will NOT instantiate any fields that take the type
 * Collection.
