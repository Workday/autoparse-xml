/**
 * Marks a package as the root of a parser partition. All classes annotated with {@link XmlElement}
 * that exist in this package and its subpackages (excluding subpackages also annotated with
 * {@literal@}XmlParserPartition) will be included in this partition. Subpackages similarly
 * annotated will generate their own partition. All classes annotated with {@literal@}ParseFor that
 * do not have an ancestor package annotated with {@literal@}XmlParserPartition) will be placed into
 * a default partition.
 * <p/>
 * It is recommended that you place this annotation in the package-info.java file of that package,
 * like so:
 * <pre>
 *     {@literal@}XmlModelPartition
 *     package my.very.own.package;
 *
 *     import com.workday.autoparse.xml.annotation.XmlModelPartition;
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * You have the option to partition your model classes into disjoint groups. This can be useful if
 * you have distinct groups of models you wish to create depending on the situation, and there are
 * name collisions between those groups. For example, suppose in Partition 1 you have a class that
 * maps to XML tag "My_Object" and in Partition 2 you have another class that also maps to
 * "My_Object". The two cannot exist in the same partition, but Autoparse will allow them to exist
 * in separate partitions. You may then create separate {@link XmlStreamParser}s for these
 * partitions. See {@link XmlParserSettingsBuilder#withPartitions(String...)}.
 * <p/>
 * Another situation where this might be useful is if you have multiple projects that use
 * Autoparse's code generation. Without explicit partitions, the two projects will place all parsers
 * into two separate default partitions, which will cause a duplicate class compilation error. If
 * you create an explicit partition in at least one of those two projects, the error is avoided. If
 * you intend to use Autoparse in a library, it is recommended that you create an explicit partition
 * to avoid collisions with other projects.
